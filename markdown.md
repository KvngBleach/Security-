# Security Concepts

## Administrative/Managerial Controls 

</table> Managerial controls are security policies and procedures established by an organization’s leadership to manage and oversee the security of systems and data. These controls, which are often written documents, focus on planning, assessing, and improving the organization’s security posture.

Here are examples of managerial control.

* Security Policies: Security policies are written documents that outline your company’s approach to cybersecurity. They define roles and responsibilities, acceptable use, access control policy, and more.

* Incident Response Plan: An incident response plan explains the process and procedures your organization should follow to identify, manage, and respond to security threats.

## Physical Controls 

</table> Physical security controls are security measures that you can touch. They work by discouraging potential intruders from entering your premises.

Here are key examples of physical security controls:

* Access Control Systems: Keycards or biometric scanners help restrict entry to authorized personnel only.

* Surveillance Cameras: Surveillance cameras monitor activities and deter crime by making potential intruders aware they are being watched. Additionally, they provide useful evidence for investigations.

* Security Personnel: Employing trained security guards to patrol the premises can discourage unauthorized personnel from entering your premises.

* Fencing and Barriers: Fences and barriers dissuade potential intruders from entering your premises.

## Technical/Logical Controls 

</table> Technical controls use hardware and software to protect your IT infrastructure. Once your IT administrators have installed and configured technical security controls, they will start protecting your systems and resources automatically.

Here are popular examples of technical security controls.

* Firewalls: Firewalls check and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. They act as a security barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks, effectively blocking unauthorized access and helping to prevent cyber attacks.

* Multi-factor Authentication (MFA): If you implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) in your organization, users must provide multiple forms of verification, such as a password and a text message code, before accessing systems. This practice makes it challenging for threat actors to gain unauthorized access to user accounts, even if they successfully obtain passwords using brute force attack tools.

* Encryption: Encrypting sensitive data in your organization protects it from prying eyes. Even if hackers intercept your data during transmission or gain unauthorized access, they cannot read or understand it.

* Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS): IDPS detect and block security threats before it can cause any harm to your IT network. It is an important technical security control used by most organizations today.

* Endpoint Protection Platform (EPP): Endpoint protection platforms offer various security features, such as data loss protection, protection from malicious downloads, incident investigation and remediation, and more. These features help protect endpoints from security threats.

## Operational Controls 

</table> Operational controls focus on making sure that your organisational day-to-day operations are aligned with your overall security goals. Unlike technical controls that are executed by systems, these controls are often executed by people.

Here are examples of operational controls:

* Configuration Management: A configuration management plan ensures that all systems use secure baseline settings instead of default settings. This helps prevent hackers from exploiting vulnerabilities that result from poor configuration settings.

* Security Awareness Training: Regular cybersecurity training helps your employees follow cybersecurity best practices, such as creating strong passwords, understanding threats of social engineering attacks, and avoiding clicking unknown links. This helps your company to meet its overall security goals.

* User account Management: Managing user accounts involves giving the right access to individuals based on their roles and deleting accounts once employees leave the company. Use account management helps ensure that data access aligns with the least privilege principle.

* Patch Management: Regularly updating and applying software patches is an ongoing operational task to prevent vulnerabilities, ensuring that day-to-day system management is in line with security goals. You can explore these best patch management software to automate updates in your organization.

# Defending Against Attacks

## Preventative Controls

</table> Preventive security controls, as the name suggests, protect your IT infrastructure from threats and attacks by preventing security threats from occurring. Some people call them preventative controls, but both terms mean the same thing. 

Here are key examples of preventive controls:

* Hardening: Application hardening involves enhancing security beyond the default settings. This process includes actions like changing default passwords to strong ones, enabling multi-factor authentication, blocking open ports, and deactivating unnecessary accounts. Reducing the attack surface by hardening limits opportunities for hackers to exploit vulnerabilities in the application.

* Firewall: A firewall monitors and controls incoming and outgoing traffic based on predetermined security rules. By filtering malicious data packets, a firewall can block unauthorized access while allowing legitimate traffic. This prevents hackers from reaching internal systems, thereby acting as an effective preventive security control. You can explore these managed firewalls to find the best solution for your company.

* Intrusion Prevention System (IPS): An Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) actively detects and blocks security threats before they can reach your network, preventing potential security incidents. We have prepared a list of the best IPS software to help you make an informed decision based on your needs.

* Antivirus Software: An Antivirus program protects systems from various types of malware, including viruses, ransomware, spyware, and more. You can check these antivirus software to pick the right program for your business.

* Regular Software Updates: Keeping your systems’ software and operating systems up-to-date prevents threat actors from exploiting known vulnerabilities to enter your network.

* Account Disablement Policy: An account disablement policy makes sure that all accounts associated with an employee are disabled when they leave your organization. This prevents them from accessing confidential data after their departure. Failing to deactivate ex-employee accounts poses a severe security risk, as they could leak sensitive information to competitors or post it online out of resentment, causing a data breach.

## Detective Controls 

</table> Detective security controls help you identify when vulnerabilities were exploited, paving the way for hackers to intrude into your systems. You need to understand that detectives can identify an event once it has occurred.

Here are key examples of detective security controls.

* Security Incident Event Management Tools (SIEM): SIEM systems collect and analyze data from multiple networking sources, such as router, firewall, and endpoints to detect security threats in real time. They help identify suspicious activities and provide alerts for possible incidents.

* Intrusion Detection System: An IDS monitors network traffic or system activities to detect any unusual or unauthorized actions. When it detects potential threats or intrusions, it generates alerts, allowing security teams to respond promptly.

* Motion Detectors: These devices detect movements in areas where there shouldn’t be any activity, such as restricted areas. Motion detectors alert security personnel to investigate any detected motion that could indicate an intrusion.

* Video Surveillance Camera: These cameras record activities in various areas of your facility, allowing your security teams to use this footage to detect suspicious behavior or review incidents after they occur to understand how they happened.

## Deterrents Controls

</table> Deterrent controls reduce the likelihood of attacks by discouraging bad actors from attacking. They can also dissuade your staff from taking a casual approach to cybersecurity.

Here are a few widely used examples of deterrent controls:

* Warning Signs: Warning signs stating that the facility is under surveillance cameras can discourage many intruders from entering.

* Login Banners: Displaying login banners that declare unauthorized access a crime can deter your staff members from attempting to access accounts they don’t own, even if they know the login credentials.

* Security Guards: The presence of security guards in your facility can discourage many unauthorized individuals from entering your premises.

* Lighting: Proper lighting that eliminates dark spots in your facility can deter intruders who use darkness to gain unauthorized entry into a building.

* Security Policies: Security policies that clearly outline the disciplinary consequences of violating cybersecurity best practices can discourage employees from showing a lax attitude towards cybersecurity.

## Corrective Controls 

</table> Once inside your network, threat actors are likely to cause severe damage, impacting your IT resources’ confidentiality, integrity, and availability. They can encrypt files, install spyware, steal data, and whatnot.

Corrective controls are used to reverse the damage caused by a security incident after it happened. The objective of corrective controls is to get things back to normal as soon as possible.

Here are key examples of corrective controls.

* Antivirus Software: After an infection occurs, antivirus programs can scan the device, quarantine infected files, and restore the system to a secure state.

* Restoration from Backups: If data is lost due to a cyberattack or system failure, restoring from backups helps recover the information and minimize downtime.

* Password Resets: After a security breach occurs, you should reset all passwords to prevent unauthorized access. This process helps secure accounts and ensures that only authorized users regain access.

* Security Training: Providing additional employee training after a security incident helps raise awareness of potential threats and proper security practices. This training reinforces the importance of following security protocols and helps prevent future incidents.

## Compensating Controls 

</table> Compensating security controls are implemented when organizations cannot apply primary security controls or when those primary controls do not provide adequate protection.

Here are some examples of compensating controls.

* Strict Access Controls: If an organization cannot segregate duties for sensitive processes, it might implement strict access controls and carry out regular security audits to monitor user activities.

* Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Solutions: If encryption is not possible for data in transit, organizations may implement DLP solutions to monitor and control the flow of sensitive information outside the network.

* Employee Training and Awareness: If technical controls like spam filters cannot effectively prevent phishing attacks, providing extensive staff training on recognizing and responding to phishing attacks, email spoofing, typosquatting, and other security threats can serve as a compensating control.

## Directive Controls

</table> Directive security controls provide guidance for users to follow in security-related situations. These controls are typically documented instructions rather than technical tools aimed at achieving security objectives. Their primary purpose is to influence and direct the behavior of individuals within an organization to meet specific security goals.

Examples of directive security controls include:

* Acceptable Use Policy: A written document outlining the acceptable behaviors and practices for using organizational resources, such as computers, networks, and internet access.

* Security Awareness Training: These training programs are designed to educate employees about cybersecurity threats, best practices, and their roles in protecting the organization’s assets and information.

* Incident Response Plan: An incident response plan is a written document that guides security teams in taking the necessary steps to minimize the impact of a security incident on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of resources. It also helps restore systems to normal operation.

## Importance of Security Controls

</table> Security controls protect your organization from security threats by identifying, mitigating, and reducing the impact of security incidents.

Here are key reasons why it is important to implement security controls.

* Risk Mitigation: Security controls reduce the likelihood and impact of security incidents.

* Data Protection: Security controls protect your data from unauthorized access. They can help you ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your data resources. You can check these data security solutions to protect data in your organization.

* Regulatory Compliance: Depending on your industry, you may be liable to some regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) that require you to implement security measures to protect your customers’ data. Implementation of various security controls strategically can help you meet regulatory compliance.

* Trust and Reputation: Security controls reduce the frequency and impact of security incidents. This prioritization of security enhances trust and reputation among customers, vendors, stakeholders, and third parties, as they feel more secure working with organizations that take security seriously.

# Malware Types

## Viruses 

</table> In cybersecurity, a virus is a type of malicious software (malware) that, when executed, replicates itself by inserting copies of its code into other computer programs, data files, or the boot sector of the hard drive. This self-replication is the defining characteristic of a computer virus.

* Self-Replication: This is the core function of a virus. It needs a host program or file to attach itself to. When the infected host is executed, the virus code is also run, and it then seeks out other susceptible files or areas to infect.

* Host Dependency: Viruses cannot exist or spread without a host. They need to attach themselves to an executable file (.exe, .com), a document with macros (like .doc or .xls), or the boot sector (the part of the hard drive that starts the operating system).

* Activation: A virus typically remains dormant until the infected host file is executed or the infected boot sector is accessed. This activation can be triggered by a user opening an infected file, booting the computer from an infected drive, or another system event.

* Payload Delivery: Once activated, a virus can deliver a malicious "payload." This payload can range from being relatively harmless (like displaying annoying messages or slowing down the system) to severely damaging (like deleting files, corrupting data, stealing information, or giving an attacker control over the system).

* Spread Mechanism: Viruses spread when the infected host file is transferred to another computer (e.g., via email attachment, USB drive, network share). When the recipient executes the infected file, the virus activates and can then infect other files on their system and potentially spread further.

          In essence, a computer virus is a piece of malicious code that attaches itself to a host program and replicates by modifying other programs to include its own code. This self-replication allows it to spread rapidly from one computer to another, often causing harm through its payload. Understanding the mechanisms of how viruses spread and the types of damage they can inflict is crucial for implementing effective cybersecurity practices.



## Ransomware

</table> Ransomware is software that uses encryption to disable a target’s access to its data until a ransom is paid. The victim organization is rendered partially or totally unable to operate until it pays, but there is no guarantee that payment will result in the necessary decryption key or that the decryption key provided will function properly.

     This year, the city of Baltimore was hit by a type of ransomware named RobbinHood, which halted all city activities, including tax collection, property transfers, and government email for weeks. This attack has cost the city more than $18 million so far, and costs continue to accrue. The same type of malware was used against the city of Atlanta in 2018, resulting in costs of $17 million.

## Trojans

</table> In cybersecurity, a Trojan horse (often simply called a Trojan) is a type of malicious software (malware) that disguises itself as a legitimate or harmless program to trick users into installing it. Unlike viruses and worms, Trojans do not self-replicate. Instead, they rely on social engineering to deceive users into executing them.

     Imagine you receive an email that appears to be from a reputable software company (e.g., Adobe, Microsoft). The email claims that there's a critical security update for one of their popular programs (like Adobe Reader or Microsoft Office). The email looks very convincing, with the company's logo and professional formatting. It includes a link or an attached file named something like "SecurityUpdate.exe" or "AdobePatch.zip".

* Deceptive Appearance: Trojans often masquerade as useful software, such as antivirus updates, software cracks, games, or seemingly legitimate applications. This disguise is crucial to their success.

* Non-Self-Replicating: This is a defining characteristic that distinguishes Trojans from viruses and worms. They don't automatically spread to other files or systems once executed.

* Payload Delivery: Once a Trojan is executed by the unsuspecting user, it can carry out a variety of malicious activities, known as its "payload." These payloads can include:

          Backdoors: Allowing attackers remote access and control over the infected system.

          Data Theft: Stealing sensitive information like passwords, financial data, personal files, and browsing history.

          Keylogging: Recording keystrokes to capture login credentials and other sensitive text.

          Spyware: Monitoring user activity, taking screenshots, and recording audio/video.

          Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks: Using the infected machine to launch attacks against other systems.

          Ransomware Installation: Encrypting files and demanding a ransom for their decryption.

          Botnet Recruitment: Turning the infected computer into a "bot" that can be controlled remotely as part of a larger network for malicious purposes.
          Deleting or Modifying Files: Causing data loss or system instability.

          User Interaction Required: Trojans typically require some form of user interaction to be executed, such as clicking on a malicious attachment, downloading and running a fake program, or visiting a compromised website that triggers a drive-by download. In essence, a Trojan horse in cybersecurity is a malicious program that hides its true intentions behind a seemingly benign facade, relying on deception to gain access to a system and carry out harmful actions. Understanding how Trojans operate is crucial for individuals and organizations to implement effective security measures and avoid becoming victims of these deceptive threats.

## Worms

</table> A worm in cybersecurity is a type of self-replicating malware that spreads across networks by exploiting security vulnerabilities in computer systems. Unlike viruses, which require a host program to attach to, worms are standalone malicious programs that can propagate independently once they have infected a system.

* Self-Replication: This is the defining characteristic of a worm. Once a worm infects a system, it can automatically create copies of itself and spread to other connected computers without requiring any user interaction.

* Network Propagation: Worms are specifically designed to spread across networks, often exploiting network protocols, email systems, file sharing, or software vulnerabilities to reach new hosts.

* Standalone Nature: Unlike viruses that need to attach to an executable file, worms are independent programs that can execute and replicate on their own.

* Exploitation of Vulnerabilities: Worms often leverage security flaws in operating systems, applications, or network services to gain access to systems and spread. 
  
* Potential for Significant Damage: Due to their rapid self-replication and network-spreading capabilities, worms can cause widespread damage, including:

          Network Congestion: Consuming bandwidth and slowing down or crashing networks due to the sheer volume of traffic generated by replication.
            
          System Resource Exhaustion: Overloading infected systems by consuming CPU processing power, memory, and disk space, leading to performance degradation or system crashes.   

          Data Theft or Corruption: Some worms carry malicious payloads that can steal sensitive information, delete files, or corrupt data.

          Backdoor Installation: Worms can open backdoors on infected systems, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized remote access.

          Launching Further Attacks: Infected systems can be used as launching points for other malicious activities, such as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

## Spyware

</table> Spyware collects information about users’ activities without their knowledge or consent. This can include passwords, pins, payment information and unstructured messages.The use of spyware is not limited to the desktop browser: it can also operate in a critical app or on a mobile phone.Even if the data stolen is not critical, the effects of spyware often ripple throughout the organization as performance is degraded and productivity eroded.

     DarkHotel, which targeted business and government leaders using hotel WIFI, used several types of malware in order to gain access to the systems belonging to specific powerful people. Once that access was gained, the attackers installed keyloggers to capture their targets passwords and other sensitive information.

## Adware

</table> Adware tracks a user’s surfing activity to determine which ads to serve them. Although adware is similar to spyware, it does not install any software on a user’s computer, nor does it capture keystrokes. The danger in adware is the erosion of a user’s privacy — the data captured by adware is collated with data captured, overtly or covertly, about the user’s activity elsewhere on the internet and used to create a profile of that person which includes who their friends are, what they’ve purchased, where they’ve traveled, and more. That information can be shared or sold to advertisers without the user’s consent.

    Adware called Fireball infected 250 million computers and devices in 2017, hijacking browsers to change default search engines and track web activity. However, the malware had the potential to become more than a mere nuisance. Three-quarters of it was able to run code remotely and download malicious files.

## Bloatware

</table> Bloatware refers to pre-installed software on a device (like a computer or smartphone) that the user often finds unnecessary or unwanted. It typically comes bundled by the manufacturer or carrier and consumes system resources, potentially slowing down performance and taking up storage space.

* Pre-installed: Bloatware is not installed by the user but comes with the device right out of the box.

* Unwanted or Unnecessary: Users often perceive these applications as superfluous, as they may already have preferred alternatives or never intend to use them.
   
* Resource Intensive: Bloatware can run in the background, consuming RAM and CPU cycles, which can lead to slower performance and reduced battery life.
  
* Storage Consumption: These pre-installed apps occupy valuable storage space on the device, which can be a significant issue, especially on devices with limited internal memory. 
  
* Difficult to Remove: In many cases, bloatware is not easily uninstallable through standard methods. Users might need to resort to more advanced techniques or even rooting/jailbreaking their devices to completely remove it.

          In essence, bloatware is the digital equivalent of clutter on a new device – pre-loaded software that many users would prefer not to have and that can negatively impact the device's performance and available storage. While some pre-installed software might be useful to certain users, the term "bloatware" generally carries a negative connotation due to its often unwanted nature and potential impact on device efficiency.

## Keyloggers 

</table> A keylogger (also known as a keystroke logger) is a type of surveillance software or hardware device that records the keys pressed on a computer keyboard, typically in a covert manner so that the user is unaware their actions are being monitored.

* Keystroke Recording: The primary function of a keylogger is to capture every keystroke entered by the user. This includes letters, numbers, symbols, function keys, and even system commands.

* Covert Operation: Keyloggers are designed to operate stealthily in the background without the user's knowledge or consent. They often don't have a visible interface or generate any suspicious activity that would alert the user.  

* Data Storage and Retrieval: The recorded keystrokes are typically stored in a log file on the local machine or transmitted remotely to the attacker, depending on the type of keylogger. Attackers can then access these logs to retrieve sensitive information.   

* Software and Hardware Forms: Keyloggers can exist in two main forms:

          Software Keyloggers: These are programs installed on the target computer, often without the user's awareness. They can be implemented as standalone applications, parts of other malware (like Trojans), or even as browser extensions.   

          Hardware Keyloggers: These are physical devices that are plugged in between the keyboard and the computer. They record keystrokes at the hardware level and store them in their internal memory.   
  


## Rootkits

</table> A rootkit is a stealthy type of malicious software (malware) designed to gain unauthorized, persistent access to a computer system while actively concealing its presence and the presence of other malicious software. The term "rootkit" originates from the "root" or administrator account on Unix-like operating systems, as gaining root access provides the highest level of control over the system.

* Stealth and Concealment: This is the defining feature of a rootkit. Its primary goal is to remain undetected by standard operating system functions, security software (like antivirus), and the user. It achieves this by manipulating the operating system itself.

* Persistence: Rootkits aim to establish a long-term foothold on the compromised system, allowing attackers to maintain control and carry out malicious activities over an extended period. 
  
* Privileged Access: Once installed, a rootkit often grants the attacker root-level or administrator privileges, giving them complete control over the infected system.

* Hiding Other Malware: Rootkits are often used to hide the presence of other malicious software, such as backdoors, keyloggers, and bots, making it difficult to detect and remove the entire malicious package. 
  
* Operating System Manipulation: Rootkits achieve their stealth by modifying core components of the operating system, including:

          System Calls: Intercepting and altering system calls to filter out evidence of their presence or the presence of other malware. 
            
          Kernel Objects: Hiding processes, files, registry entries, and network connections associated with the rootkit and other malicious software. 
            
          Device Drivers: Replacing legitimate drivers with malicious ones to gain control at a low level and intercept system operations.

          Bootloaders: Some rootkits infect the bootloader to gain control of the system before the operating system even starts.   


## Logic Bombs

</table> A logic bomb in cybersecurity is a piece of malicious code intentionally inserted into a software system. This code lies dormant until a specific predefined condition or set of conditions is met. Once triggered, the logic bomb executes its malicious payload, which can range from displaying an unwanted message to deleting critical data, disrupting system operations, or granting unauthorized access.

* Dormant State: Unlike viruses or worms that often execute immediately upon infection, a logic bomb remains inactive within the system until its trigger conditions are satisfied. This stealthy nature can make them difficult to detect.  

* Trigger Conditions: These are the specific criteria that must be met for the logic bomb to activate. These conditions can be diverse and include:

          A specific date or time.

          A particular user logging into the system.

          A certain number of times a program is executed.

          The deletion or modification of a specific file.

          A particular sequence of user actions.

          A specific network event.

* Malicious Payload: Once triggered, the logic bomb executes its intended harmful action. The severity of the payload can vary greatly, including:

          Displaying nuisance messages or pop-ups.

          Corrupting or deleting files and data.   

          Disrupting network services.

          Crashing the operating system.

          Granting unauthorized access to the system.

          Stealing sensitive information.

          Internal Threat Potential: Logic bombs are often planted by individuals with legitimate access to the system, such as disgruntled employees or insiders. This makes them particularly challenging to prevent and detect, as the malicious code can be embedded within seemingly legitimate parts of the software.  

          Delayed Impact: The delayed activation of a logic bomb can make it difficult to trace the malicious activity back to its source. The system might function normally for an extended period before the bomb suddenly detonates. 

 # Social Engineering Tactics

 </table> Social engineering in cybersecurity refers to the psychological manipulation of people to perform actions or divulge confidential information. Instead of exploiting technical vulnerabilities in systems, social engineers exploit human behavior and emotions to gain access to data, systems, or locations.

Think of it as "hacking the human" rather than hacking the computer. Attackers use deception and persuasion tactics to trick individuals into making security mistakes.

* Human Element Focus: Social engineering targets the inherent trust, helpfulness, fear, or urgency that individuals might feel.

* Manipulation and Deception: Attackers create scenarios or impersonate individuals or organizations to convince their targets to take specific actions.

* Goal-Oriented: The ultimate goal is usually to obtain sensitive information (like passwords, financial details, or personal data), gain unauthorized access to systems or physical locations, or persuade victims to install malware or transfer funds.

* Varied Techniques: Social engineering attacks can take many forms, occurring online, over the phone, or even in person.

          In essence, social engineering is about convincing people to do something they shouldn't, by exploiting their natural tendencies and psychological responses. It's a significant threat because humans are often the weakest link in the security chain.
 ## Phishing 

</table> Phishing is a type of social engineering attack where malicious actors attempt to deceive individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, credit card details, or other personal data, by disguising themselves as trustworthy entities. Think of it as "fishing" for sensitive information by casting out deceptive "bait."

* Deception is Central: Phishing relies heavily on trickery and manipulation. Attackers craft messages (typically emails, but also texts, phone calls, or even social media messages) that appear to be from legitimate organizations or people the target trusts.
   
* Impersonation of Trusted Entities: Attackers commonly impersonate well-known companies (banks, social media platforms, online retailers), government agencies, or even colleagues and friends. They often use logos, branding, and language that closely resemble the real entity. 
  
* Urgency and Fear Tactics: Phishing attempts often create a sense of urgency or fear to pressure victims into acting quickly without thinking critically. For example, a message might claim that an account has been compromised and requires immediate action to secure it, or that a payment is overdue and will result in service suspension.   

* Requests for Sensitive Information: The ultimate goal of a phishing attack is to get the victim to divulge confidential data. This can be done through various means:

          Malicious Links: The message often contains links that lead to fake websites designed to look like the legitimate organization's login or information entry pages. Any data entered on these fake sites is then stolen by the attackers.   

          Malicious Attachments: Attachments may contain malware that, once opened, can steal information, install backdoors, or perform other malicious actions.   

          Direct Requests: The message might directly ask for sensitive information, such as a password reset or account verification, often under a false pretense. 

* Wide Range of Attack Vectors: While email is the most common method, phishing attacks can also occur via:

          Smishing (SMS Phishing): Using text messages.
             
          Vishing (Voice Phishing): Using phone calls. 
            
          Social Media Phishing: Using direct messages or fake posts.   

          Spear Phishing: Highly targeted attacks aimed at specific individuals or organizations, often using personalized information to increase credibility.  
           
          Whaling: A type of spear phishing that targets high-profile individuals like CEOs or senior executives.
