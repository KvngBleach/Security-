# Security Concepts

## Administrative/Managerial Controls are the policies and procedures I'm always talking about. They aren't as "cool" as a new software control, but they exist to give structure and guidance to individuals like you, and other members of your organization, ensuring nobody gets fined or causes a breach.

## Physical Controls limit the access to systems in a physical way; fences, CCTV, dogs... and everybody's favorite: fire sprinklers.

## Technical/Logical Controls are those that limit access on a hardware or software basis, such as encryption, fingerprint readers, authentication, or Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs). These don't limit access to the physical systems the way physical controls do, but rather access to the data or contents.

## Operational Controls are those that involve people conducting processes on a day-to-day level. Examples could include awareness training, asset classification, and reviewing log files.

# Defending Against Attacks

## Preventative Controls exist to not allow an action to happen and include firewalls, fences, and access permissions.

* Hardening: Application hardening involves enhancing security beyond the default settings. This process includes actions like changing default passwords to strong ones, enabling multi-factor authentication, blocking open ports, and deactivating unnecessary accounts. Reducing the attack surface by hardening limits opportunities for hackers to exploit vulnerabilities in the application.

* Firewall: A firewall monitors and controls incoming and outgoing traffic based on predetermined security rules. By filtering malicious data packets, a firewall can block unauthorized access while allowing legitimate traffic. This prevents hackers from reaching internal systems, thereby acting as an effective preventive security control. You can explore these managed firewalls to find the best solution for your company.

* Intrusion Prevention System (IPS): An Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) actively detects and blocks security threats before they can reach your network, preventing potential security incidents. We have prepared a list of the best IPS software to help you make an informed decision based on your needs.

* Antivirus Software: An Antivirus program protects systems from various types of malware, including viruses, ransomware, spyware, and more. You can check these antivirus software to pick the right program for your business.

* Regular Software Updates: Keeping your systems’ software and operating systems up-to-date prevents threat actors from exploiting known vulnerabilities to enter your network.

* Account Disablement Policy: An account disablement policy makes sure that all accounts associated with an employee are disabled when they leave your organization. This prevents them from accessing confidential data after their departure. Failing to deactivate ex-employee accounts poses a severe security risk, as they could leak sensitive information to competitors or post it online out of resentment, causing a data breach.

## Detective Controls are only triggered during or after an event, such as video surveillance, or intrusion detection systems.

* Warning Signs: Warning signs stating that the facility is under surveillance cameras can discourage many intruders from entering.

* Login Banners: Displaying login banners that declare unauthorized access a crime can deter your staff members from attempting to access accounts they don’t own, even if they know the login credentials.

* Security Guards: The presence of security guards in your facility can discourage many unauthorized individuals from entering your premises.

* Lighting: Proper lighting that eliminates dark spots in your facility can deter intruders who use darkness to gain unauthorized entry into a building.

* Security Policies: Security policies that clearly outline the disciplinary consequences of violating cybersecurity best practices can discourage employees from showing a lax attitude towards cybersecurity.

### Deterrents discourage threats from attempting to exploit a vulnerability, such as a "Guard Dog" sign, or dogs.

### Corrective Controls are able to take an action from one state to another. This is where fail open and fail closed controls are addressed.

### Recovery Controls get something back from a loss, such as the recovery of a hard drive.

### Compensating Controls are those that attempt to make up for the shortcomings of other controls, such as reviewing access logs regularly. This example is also a detective control, but compensating controls can be of various different types.
